# TopDeal - E-Commerce Android App

### Welcome to our online shopping app! Our app is designed to make it easy for buyers to browse and purchase products, and for sellers to list and sell their products to a wide audience.

#### As a buyer, you can browse through a wide selection of products, add items to your cart, and check out securely using our payment processing system. You can also save your favorite items to a wishlist for later.

#### As a seller, you can list your products for sale on our platform, and reach a wide audience of potential buyers. All products listed by sellers must be approved by an admin before they are made available for purchase.

#### As an admin, you have the ability to edit or remove products from the app, and to approve or reject products listed by sellers. You can also manage the shipping process for purchased items.
